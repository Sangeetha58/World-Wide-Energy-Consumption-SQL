# World Wide Energy Consumption – SQL Project 🌍

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global energy consumption data across countries using SQL.  
The dataset includes information related to population, GDP, energy production, consumption, and emissions.

## 🗂️ Datasets Used
- Country
- Consumption
- Production
- Emission
- GDP
- Population

## 🧱 Database Design
- Created a relational database using MySQL
- Designed ER Diagram with `country` as the parent table
- Implemented one-to-many relationships using foreign keys

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Total emissions per country
- Top countries by GDP and population
- Energy production vs consumption comparison
- Trend analysis of emissions and energy consumption
- Per-capita and ratio-based analysis (emission-to-GDP, consumption per capita)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, Aggregations)
- ER Diagram

## 🎥 Project Demo
A video demonstrating SQL query execution and analysis has been shared on LinkedIn.
